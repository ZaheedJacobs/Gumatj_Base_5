# Gumatj_Base_5
Gumatj (or base 5/quinary) is a numbering system with numbers ranging from 0 to 4, and multiples of 5 are represented as 10, 100, etc.

The user will be asked to choose 1 out of 4 operations involving base 5:
1) "d {number}" -> takes the number in base 5 and converts it into base 10.
2) "g {number}" -> takes the number in base 10 and converts it into base 5.
3) "a {number 1} {number 2}" -> takes the 2 numbers in base 5, converts them into base 10 (decimal) and adds them, making sure to convert the final answer back into base 5.
4) "m {number 1} {number 2}" -> takes the 2 numbers in base 5, converts them into base 10 and multiplies them, and converts the final answer back into base 5.

If the user-specified string does not match any of these options, the user will be asked again to enter a choice string.
